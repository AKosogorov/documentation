# Mission

Here we describe the goals and limitations of the applicability of the methodology-which we are guided by when developing the methodology

- We see our goal as a balance between ideology and simplicity
- We won't be able to make a silver bullet that fits everyone

**Nevertheless, I would like the methodology to be close and accessible to a fairly wide range of developers**

## Goals

### Intuitive clarity for a wide range of developers

The methodology should be available - for most of the team in projects

*Because even with all the future tools , it will not be enough for only experienced seniors/leads to understand the methodology*

### Solving everyday problems

The methodology should set out the reasons and solutions to our everyday problems when developing projects

**And also-attach tools to all this (cli, linters)**

So that developers can use a *proven experience* approach that allows them to bypass long-standing problems of architecture and development

> *@sergeysova: Imagine-a developer writes code within the framework of the methodology and he has problems 10 times less often, simply because other people have thought out the solution to many problems.*

## Restrictions

We do not want to *impose our point of view*, and at the same time we understand that *many of our habits, as developers, interfere from day to day*

Everyone has their own level of experience in designing and developing systems, **therefore, it is worth understanding the following:**

- **Will not work**: very simple, very clear, for everyone
    > *@sergeysova: Some concepts cannot be intuitively understood until you encounter problems and spend years solving them.*
    >
    > - *An example from mathematics is graph theory.*
    >
    > - *Example from physics-quantum mechanics.*
    > - *Example from programming-application architecture.*
    >
- **Possible and desirable**: simplicity, extensibility
