# Types of knowledge in the project

In any project, you can distinguish certain types of knowledge

## Fundamental knowledge

**Knowledge that practically does not change over time.**

*Algorithms, computer science, the mechanisms of the YAP and its API, etc.*

## Technology stack

**Knowledge about the set of technical solutions used in the project.**

*Programming languages, frameworks, libraries, etc.*

## Project knowledge

**Knowledge that is applicable exclusively within the framework of the current project.**

*They are not transferred to the outside world in any way and, having left this project, you can forget about this knowledge.*

*Naturally, this also works in the opposite direction â€” to add a new person to the current project, you need to train him **a certain minimum amount of this project knowledge** - without which a new participant will not be able to perform useful work*
