# Knowledge types in the project

The following "types of knowledge" can be distinguished in any project:

**Fundamental knowledge**

Knowledge that does not change much over time, such as algorithms, computer science, programming language mechanisms and its APIs.

**Technology stack**

Knowledge of the set of technical solutions used in a project, including programming languages, frameworks, and libraries.

**Project knowledge**

Knowledge that is specific to the current project and is not transferable to other contexts. When a person leaves the project, they may forget about this knowledge. When a new person joins the project, they need to be taught a certain minimum amount of design knowledge specific to the project so that they can contribute effectively.

:::note

**Feature-Sliced Design** is designed to reduce reliance on "design knowledge", take more responsibility, and make it easier to onboard new team members.
