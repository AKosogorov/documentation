**Feature-Sliced Design** (FSD) is an architectural methodology for scaffolding front-end applications. Simply put, it's a compilation of rules and conventions on organizing code. The main purpose of this methodology is to make the project more understandable and structured in the face of ever-changing business requirements.

Here is how it's accomplished:

- A strong foundation of **time-tested** design practices:  
  _SOLID, GRASP, DDD, Separation of Concerns, Vertical Slices, Public API, Isolation._
- Project partitioning on business domains
- Consistency in file structure

The methodology is not tied to any particular technology stack and is applicable to most front-end projects. This documentation contains examples in JavaScript + React, but FSD has been successfully adapted to other technology stacks (see [project examples][refs-examples]).

## Basics

![schema](/img/visual_schema.jpg)

The terms in the diagram above are explained in detail in the [**Abstractions**][refs-basics--abstractions] section.

Such a structure has a number of benefits:

- **Uniformity**  
  The code is organized by scope of influence (layers), by domain (slices), and by technical purpose (segments).  
  This creates a standardized architecture that is easier to comprehend for newcomers.

- **Controlled reuse of logic**  
  Each architectural component has its purpose and predictable dependencies.  
  This keeps a balance between following the **DRY** principle and adaptation possibilities. 

- **Stability in face of changes and refactoring**  
  A module on a particular layer cannot use other modules on the same layer, or the layers above.  
  This enables isolated modifications without unforeseen consequences.


## Motivation

Front-end architecture approaches are usually re-invented from scratch with every project, adding up to the "project knowledge". Incorrect decisions often lead to issues with scalability, both for the project and the team. Thus, instead of re-inventing and documenting the architecture from scratch, we'd want to **aggregate the experience and construct a working, tested and documented methodology** for front-end architecture.

In the [**Motivation**][refs-motivation] section, we go in depth on the reasons behind creating this methodology and compare it to other existing approaches.  
In the [**About architecture**][refs-architecture] section, we list some of the most common issues with projects and propose a list of requirements for an ideal architecture. Feature-Sliced Design aims to follow these requirements.
