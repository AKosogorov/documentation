# 🔎 Intro

**Feature-Sliced Design** (FSD) is an architectural methodology for scaffolding front-end applications. Simply put, it's a compilation of rules and conventions on organizing code. The main purpose of this methodology is to make the project more understandable and structured in the face of ever-changing business requirements.

## Is it right for me?

FSD can be implemented in projects and teams of any size, but there are a few things to keep in mind:

- This methodology is for front-end projects only. If you're looking for a back-end architecture, consider [Clean Architecture][refs-clean-architecture].
- A very simple app of a single page might not need the benefits of FSD and suffer from the overhead. However, FSD promotes a nice way of thinking, so feel free to use on the tiniest projects if you want.
- A huge app, the size of the Google Cloud admin dashboard, will require a custom architecture. It could still be based on FSD, by the way 😎.

FSD doesn't enforce a particular programming language, UI framework or state manager — bring your own or see some [examples][refs-examples].

If you have an existing project, fear not — FSD can be adopted incrementally. Just make sure that your team is **in&nbsp;pain** 😈 from the current architecture, otherwise a switch might not be worth it. <!-- For migration guidance, see the Migration section. TODO: add the migration section and link to it here -->

## Basics

In radically simplified terms, FSD boils down to the following:

- Project partitioning on business domains
- Specific and consistent file structure (see the image below)

The terms in the diagram above are explained in detail in the [**Abstractions**][refs-basics--abstractions] section.

Such a structure has a number of benefits:

- **Uniformity**  
  The code is organized by scope of influence (layers), by domain (slices), and by technical purpose (segments).  
  This creates a standardized architecture that is easier to comprehend for newcomers.

- **Controlled reuse of logic**  
  Each architectural component has its purpose and predictable dependencies.  
  This keeps a balance between following the **DRY** principle and adaptation possibilities. 

- **Stability in face of changes and refactoring**  
  A module on a particular layer cannot use other modules on the same layer, or the layers above.  
  This enables isolated modifications without unforeseen consequences.


## Motivation

Front-end architecture approaches are usually re-invented from scratch with every project, adding up to the "project knowledge". Incorrect decisions often lead to issues with scalability, both for the project and the team. Thus, instead of re-inventing and documenting the architecture from scratch, we'd want to **aggregate the experience and construct a working, tested and documented methodology** for front-end architecture.

In the [**Motivation**][refs-motivation] section, we go in depth on the reasons behind creating this methodology and compare it to other existing approaches.  
In the [**About architecture**][refs-architecture] section, we list some of the most common issues with projects and propose a list of requirements for an ideal architecture. Feature-Sliced Design aims to follow these requirements.
