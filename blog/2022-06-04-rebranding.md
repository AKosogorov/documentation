TLDR: We've made whole new identity for FSD website and all related projects, feel free to use brand assets

<!--truncate-->

For a long time FSD had [inconsistent legacy identity](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11Y-3qZ_C9jOFoW2UbSp11YasOhw4yBdl?usp=sharing). Old design was not representing core-concepts of methodology because it was created as a pure draft. After long time it should have been actualized. So, for compatible and long-term use of the brand, we carefully rebranded FSD signature style.

So, let's take a deep dive and decompose ideas behind redesign. The light glow on new logo resembles warm brightness of old CRT monitors, passing the idea of a long history of software architecture. Geometry slightly refers to legacy logo to maintain continuity. It also subtly provides the idea of vertical layers and clear boundaries between them. Effects and colors are neutral and friendly to seamlessly pervade any page like FSD can do with projects. Lot of ideas, but, like it works with every good design, they may be seamless.

Long story short, reworked FSD identity - modern yet vintage, simple yet meaningful, strict yet notable.
