For a compatible and long-term use of the brand, we have been carefully rebranding of FSD's identity for a year (2021-2022). **So that you can be sure when using identity of FSD 🍰**

<!--truncate-->

FSD had [another legacy identity](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11Y-3qZ_C9jOFoW2UbSp11YasOhw4yBdl?usp=sharing) before. Old design didn't represent core-concepts of methodology. Also it was created as pure draft, and should have been actualized.
