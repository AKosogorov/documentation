Hello everyone

A lot of time has passed, but now we are ready to present you the v2.0-beta version of the methodology!

We tried to present here:
- Get-started materials
- Fundamentals
- Guides and application examples (including migration from v1)
- Reference material on abstractions
- General vision for the further development of the methodology

The material has been accumulated and discussed for quite a long time, so it is very important for us to get feedback from you on the current version!
- You can share your impressions and comments here in the chat, in interviews or in discussions (or even in pull requests)
- Now it is extremely important for us to collect the maximum of your wishes, cases, real problems from practice-in order to process them from the methodology side
- Work on the methodology is still in the process, a lot can change, but the foundation for a full-fledged v2 release is being laid right now (that's why a voluminous and meaningful feedback is so important to us)
