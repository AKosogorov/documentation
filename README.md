> Approach which help to define boundaries for a large application
According it we can flexibly adapt and maintain mutable functionality of app.

*There are multiple mentions and interpretations of `feature-driven` approach (see below)*

*This article contains common rules and principles.*

## [Benefits](https://www.notion.so/Summary-Feature-Driven-Architecture-talk-b8609fd4452b41f499703c841e56b8e9)

- **Discoverability -** discover how your software works
- **Work parallesisation** - to dev software by teams, not alone
- **Controlling shared abstractions -** controlling abstractions, for preventing bugs and controlling software
- **Refactoring -** we can be sure what user-facing functionality we will affect
- **AB Tests** - more controllable experiments, with quikly manipulating (many-ifs hell)
- **Integration tests** - other tests can't cover all app logic, but integration tests is difficult to create and maintain (more meaningful an easy way)

## Concepts
<!--TODO: add link anchors -->
<!--TODO: add sections (by <details/>)

- <span id="decentralization">[Decentralization](https://www.notion.so/Summary-Feature-Driven-Architecture-talk-b8609fd4452b41f499703c841e56b8e9)</span> - organize app by explicit abstractions, no interconnected monolith (app â‡’ pages â‡’ features â‡’ shared)

- **[Explicit sharing](https://www.notion.so/Summary-Feature-Driven-Architecture-talk-b8609fd4452b41f499703c841e56b8e9)** - explicit rules for managing shared (common used) modules
- **[Co-location](https://www.notion.so/Summary-Feature-Driven-Architecture-talk-b8609fd4452b41f499703c841e56b8e9)** - normalized structure for better project navigation (app, pages, features, shared)
- **[Decoupling & Isolation](https://www.notion.so/Summary-Feature-Driven-Architecture-talk-b8609fd4452b41f499703c841e56b8e9)** - every abstraction should be isolated at most
- **[Disposability](https://www.notion.so/Summary-Feature-Driven-Architecture-talk-b8609fd4452b41f499703c841e56b8e9)** - every abstraction should be optimized for remove, not modify

## App structure
```bash
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ app/
    â”œâ”€â”€ features/
    â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
    â””â”€â”€ shared/
```

## P.S. **FDA - not "silver bullet"**

There aren't lot projects examples that totally follow defined above rules.

Its caused by **very idealistic** but **hard for impl** principles

There is not one approved opinion how to do it (the same problem with DDD approach)
