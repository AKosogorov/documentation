<!-- ⚡ Add primary information & features about your repository -->
FeatureSliced is an architectural design methodology for *frontend applications*. It aims to [**divide an application according to business logic and scopes of responsibility**][refs-splitting]

- Provides [**explicitness, controllability and adaptability**][refs-arch-req] of architecture
- Based on [**experience-checked**][refs-motivation-why] design practices and concepts
    > `SOLID`, `GRASP`, `DDD`, `Separation of Concerns`, `Vertical Slices`, `Public API`, `Isolation`
- Suggests dividing the project according to [**business units**][ext-ubiq-lang]

> **Note:** The methodology is not tied to a specific tech stack and is applicable *to any frontend projects* in general.
>
> But the current version is based on and provides examples for `JavaScript` + `React` stack.

## Motivation

Usually, approaches to building the frontend architecture from project to project are [re-invented from scratch][refs-motivation], thereby adding ["project knowledge"][refs-knowledge]

> Despite the fact that the specifics of frontend projects do not differ so much

At the same time, incorrectly made decisions often lead [to problems of scalability of the project and the team][refs-arch-problems].

And therefore, instead of inventing and documenting it every time, it is better to **summarize the experience and form a working, battle-tested and documented methodology** for designing the frontend architecture.

*Yes, there are many practices and patterns (`SOLID`, `GRASP`, `DDD`, ...)*

*But for the frontend [it is highly difficult to find][refs-motivation] well-established and specific approaches*

## Overview

The methodology is designed to **simplify and standardize the decomposition of logic for large and long-lived projects.**

To do this, it introduces a number of [concepts][refs-concepts] and [abstractions][refs-splitting], on which the architecture *can be based* from project to project - from here we get *a number of advantages*

> **Note:** [Module][refs-module] - the structural unit of the project (file / directory)

### Explicit business logic

Modules are distributed according to [scope of influence, business responsibility and technical purpose][refs-splitting]

Thanks to this, *the architecture is standardized and becomes easier to read*

### Adaptation to new conditions

Each component of the architecture has its own purpose and does not affect the others

Thanks to this *it is possible to independently modify the functionality of the application to meet new requirements without unforeseen consequences*

### Technical debt and refactoring

Each module is independent and self-sufficient

Thanks to this *you can rewrite it from scratch without unexpected side effects*

### Scaling the project and the team

The increase in functionality leads to significantly less complexity of the project, since all the logic is distributed deterministically and in isolation

Thanks to this *it is easy to add and onboard new people to the team, as well as expand the functionality of the project*

### Controlled reuse of logic

Each module has its own limitations and recommendations for reuse according to [its layer][refs-splitting-layers]

Thanks to this, *a balance is maintained between compliance with the `DRY` principle and the ability to customize the module logic without overhead overrides*

## Concepts

### [`Public API`][refs-public-api]

Each module must have a **declaration of its public API** at the top level

- To connect to other modules, without the need to refer to the internal structure of this module
- To isolate the implementation details from the consumer modules
- Also, the Public API should protect the module interface after refactoring - in order to avoid unforeseen consequences

### [`Isolation`][refs-isolation]

The module should not **depend directly** on other modules of the same layer or overlying layers

- The concept is also known as `Low Coupling & High Cohesion` - to prevent implicit connections / side effects during development and refactoring

### [`Needs driven`][refs-needs-driven]

Orientation **to the needs of the business and the user**

- Also includes splitting the structure by business domains *(so-called ["slices"][refs-splitting-slices])*

## Abstractions

For [architecture design][refs-splitting] the methodology suggests operating with [familiar abstractions][refs-adaptability], but in a more consistent and consistent order.

![visual_schema](website/static/img/visual_schema.jpg)

</details>

### [`Layers`][refs-splitting-layers]

The first level of abstraction is **according to the scope of influence**

- `app` - application initialization *(init, styles, providers, ...)*
- `processes` - application business processes that manage pages *(payment, auth, ...)*
- `pages` - application pages *(user-page, ...)*
- `features` - parts of the application functionality *(auth-by-oauth, ...)*
- `entities` - business entities *(viewer, order, ...)*
- `shared` - reused infrastructure code *(UIKit, libs, API, ...)*

### [`Slices`][refs-splitting-slices]

The second level of abstraction is **according to the business domain**

The rules by which the code is divided into slices *depend on the specific project and its business rules* and are not determined by the methodology

### [`Segments`][refs-splitting-segments]

The third level of abstraction is **according to the purpose in the implementation**

- `ui` - UI-representation of the module *(components, widgets, canvas, ...)*
- `model` - business logic of the module *(store, effects/actions, hooks/contracts, ...)*
- `lib` - auxiliary libraries
- `api` - the logic of interaction with the API
- `config` - the configuration module of the application and its environment

> **Note:** In most cases, [it is recommended][ext-disc-api] to place `api` and `config` only in the shared layer
